## Hexapawn game implemented with pygame.

To play the game run the ```main.py``` file.

Rules of **Hexapawn**:
- There are two players: *Red* and *Black*.
- *Red* starts.
- Each turn each player may move a piece forward by one tile or can capture an opponents piece diagonally, like a pawn in chess.

A player wins if either:
- The opponent has no pieces left.
- The opponent has no moves left and it's their turn to move.
- One of their pawns has reached the last rank.
